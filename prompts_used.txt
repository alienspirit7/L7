Prompts used to create Python code above:
Create block that creates parameter of sample_size_n and asks user to choose this number n (lets assume user will choose 1000). The script then creates n two dimensional points each coordinate of which in between 0 to 1. You then plot those points.

Sure, I will modify the selected cell to generate and plot the random points based on the sample size.

The code has been executed and the scatter plot is displayed.

Create script that randomly choose 100 pairs of two-dimensional points a and b (each of coordinates is with also value between 0 and 1). For each one of these pairs a and b do the following: use 1000 previously created points, whose coordinates are x and y and calculate the value of errors with the following formula: (y-ax-b)^2. After you get 1000 errors calculated, get the average of all 1000 errors for this given pair of a and b. As a result you should have 100 values of avg errors. Print them on the screen.

Okay, I will add code to the selected cell to perform the requested calculations.

The average errors for each of the 100 pairs of (a, b) have been calculated and printed.

Find which pair had minimal value of the average error and plot both, 1000 points and vector that these 2 points a and b belong to

Okay, I will add code to the selected cell to find the pair with the minimum average error and then plot the points and the corresponding line.

The pair with the minimum average error has been found and the scatter plot with the best-fitting line is displayed.

Now plot 10 such vectors that had the lowest errors

Okay, I will modify the selected cell to plot the 10 vectors with the lowest average errors.

I have plotted the 10 lines with the lowest average errors along with the random points.

Make the line with the minimal error much Bolder

Okay, I will modify the plotting code to make the line with the minimal error stand out more.

It seems there was a small error in indexing. I will correct the code to properly identify the line with the minimal error and make it bolder.

I apologize for the persistent error. I will try a slightly different approach to identify the line with the minimal error within the top 10 and make it bolder.

I'm still encountering an issue with the indexing. I will add a print statement to inspect the data just before the error occurs to understand why np.argmin is not working as expected.

Ah, I see the problem. The list of average errors was not being treated as a NumPy array when trying to find the minimum within the top 10. I will convert avg_errors to a NumPy array after it's calculated, which should resolve the issue.

Great! The plot now shows the 10 best-fitting lines, with the one having the minimal error highlighted in red and made bolder.

Change the logic of random points to follow the logic where y=0.6x+0.3+random number of value between 0 and 1.

Okay, I will modify the code to generate points based on the formula y = 0.6x + 0.3 + random number between 0 and 1.

Change the logic of random points to follow the logic where y=0.6x+0.3+random number of value between 0.03 and 0.08.

Okay, I will update the code to generate points where y = 0.6x + 0.3 + a random number between 0.03 and 0.08.

I have updated the code to generate the points with the specified random noise range. You can now run the subsequent cells to see how this change affects the calculated best-fit line and the plot.
